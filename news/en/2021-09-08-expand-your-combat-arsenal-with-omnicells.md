  \r

  \r

  1.7.0 marks the **launch of omnicells**, a new gear type that adds more
  depth to your combat build. Let's dive in and learn more about omnicells.


  \r

  \r

  ## What Are Omnicells?


  \r

  \r

  Omnicells are **new craftable gear** that provide a wide range of build
  options to let you strategize around your preferred playstyle, as well as plan
  for specific encounters. To further balance combat with the launch of
  omnicells, we've changed a number of other cells and **increased attack speed
  for each weapon**.


  \r

  \r

  For more info on the changes made to existing cells, as well as the changes
  made to weapon attack speed, check out the [1.7.0 patch
  notes](https://playdauntless.com/patch-notes/1-7-0/#balance-perks).


  \r

  \r

  Omnicells are imbued with both a **passive** and **active** effect. If you
  have an omnicell equipped, you can trigger the active effect by tapping the
  button previously used for your Lantern.


  \r

  \r

  Here's a rundown of the three omnicells launching with 1.7.0.


  \r

  \r

  ### Omnicell Abilities


  \r

  \r

  {% include components/figure.html
  src=\"/assets/media/posts/news/omnicells-bastion.png\" class=\"naked\"
  caption=\"Bastion\" %}


  \r

  \r

  **Passive:** Increase all shields received by 15%. Dealing damage has a
  chance (based on damage dealt) to grant a stacking, refreshing 25 health
  shield that lasts for 25 seconds (max 500 shields).


  \r

  **Active:** Leap forward and slam the ground, consuming all shields in a
  blast of energy that deals damage to nearby targets equal to 150% the amount
  of shields consumed. 30 second cooldown.


  \r

  \r

  {% include components/figure.html
  src=\"/assets/media/posts/news/omnicells-iceborne.png\" class=\"naked\"
  caption=\"Iceborne\" %}


  \r

  \r

  **Passive:** Increase max health by 100. Gain 1% lifesteal and 5% reduced
  damage, then again for every 150 missing health. Taking damage reduces the
  cooldown of the active ability by 5 seconds (only once every 5 seconds).


  \r

  **Active:** Throw an ice lance that does 1500 frost damage; double damage if
  thrown at full health. Also prevents you from being staggered and grants +10%
  lifesteal for 8 seconds. 60 second cooldown.


  \r

  \r

  {% include components/figure.html
  src=\"/assets/media/posts/news/omnicells-discipline.png\" class=\"naked\"
  caption=\"Discipline\" %}


  \r

  \r

  **Passive:** Critical strike chance and damage increased by 10%. Healing is
  reduced by 50%. Reaching max stacks of Flaming Fist makes you Disciplined,
  increasing your critical strike chance by 50% for 40 seconds while also
  increasing damage received by 100%. When Disciplined ends, stacks are
  cleared.  \r

  **Active:** Perform a quick parrying punch that deals 300 blaze damage.
  Parrying an attack does +300% damage and grants a stack of Flaming Fist,
  giving +6% critical strike damage. This can stack 4 times. 15 second
  cooldown.\r

  \r

  ### Preparing For Omnicells\r

  \r

  As you may have gathered, we are removing the regular Iceborne and
  Discipline cells, and if you crafted at least one of these cells, **you'll be
  compensated with the omnicell version**. You'll also receive 150 steel marks
  back for each Discipline cell you crafted. Once you reach Level VII on the
  Slayer's Path, unlock the omnicell node to gain access.\r

  \r

  Additionally, **we'll refund both the Aetherheart and rams cost of any power
  surged gear you had whose Perk was changed**. Additional details can be found
  in the [1.7.0 patch
  notes](https://playdauntless.com/patch-notes/1-7-0/#balance).\r

  \r

  You can unlock Bastion and Iceborne via the Slayer's Path, and the
  Discipline omnicell recipe is available at the Lucky Break store. All
  omnicells are craftable via the Middleman.\r

  \r

  ## What's Next?\r

  \r

  We have plans to **launch more omnicells in the future**, so be on the
  lookout for additional info down the line!\r

  \r

  We'd love to hear your feedback on omnicells and the various cell changes,
  so be sure to visit our social channels on

  Clear skies, Slayer!"
